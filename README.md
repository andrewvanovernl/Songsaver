Assignment: Songsaver
Today you are going to work on creating a Single Page Application (SPA) in which you can save all your favorite songs with a rating.

Requirements
In order to meet the requirements of the (imaginary) employer, we expect your SPA to meet the following core functionalities:

As a user, I want to enter the following information about my song: title, artist, genre, rating (dropdown menu is not required).
As a user, I want to be able to click on one button so that my entered song is added to my playlist.
As a user, I want to be able to see my songs in an overview (my playlist), in which all entered data are visible.
